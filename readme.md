# CLASSIC: Ultra-high throughput mapping of genetic design space

This repository contains source code, and minimal datasets used in [O'Connell*, Rai* et al (2025)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.16.532704v3). The code and associated data is present in three sub-folders, one each corresponding to the three libraries demonstrated with `CLASSIC`. Namely - 

1. A 384-member library with diversified promoters, kozak sequences and terminators: `EU_library`
2. A 166,000-member library with 10 diversified components across a 2-gene inducible circuit: `Single_input_library`
3. A 3.4 billion-member library with 15 diversified components across a 3-gene dual inducible circuit: `Multi_input_library`

In case of any questions, or if you require any dataset or variables in addition to those provided in the repository, please contact Kshitij Rai (kshitij.rai@rice.edu) or Ronan O'Connell (ronan.oconnell3@gmail.com)
